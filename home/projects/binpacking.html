          Similar to the weight packing problem, this assigned project focused on 
          evaluating time and space complexity. Instead of evaluating package
          weights, this project focused on evaluating 3D space. This project was
          a challenge, but was a very fun problem to solve.

    <!-- What I Learned -->

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          This was my first time programming and working in a three dimensional space.
          I learned the usefulness of a coordinate system and how that can improve my
          understanding of the problem while developing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Using my knowledge of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), I created classes
          for the smaller boxes and the larger bins. Utilizing these classes helped me
          better understand how to place the smaller boxes within the larger bins. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Visualization is a powerful tool, both for the user and the developer. Using
          Matplotlib to visualize the program output gave me a better understanding of
          what was happening than a two dimensional or terminal output would have.

      <h2>Issues & Resolutions</h2>
      <div class="project-single-issue">
        <h3>What kind of algorithm should I use?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I decided that best fit could take far too long with larger inputs, and the
            opposite of best fit is inefficient. I landed on a first fit algorithm, that
            would evaluate subsections of the larger bin to place the current smaller bin
            into. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>How to evaluate the three dimensional space?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Working in three dimensions can be difficult. I settled on a coordinate system
            which would start at one corner of the object (0, 0, 0) at the bottom left
            corner for example. Then, using the dimensions of the bins, I would be able to
            calculate position as well as determining orientation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>How will "used" space be noted?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            All boxes are object, and if a smaller box is placed inside of a larger bin, 
            it's attributes will be updated to denote that. This includes its position
            inside of the larger bin, and the larger bin will be updated to show that it
            contains the smaller bin. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>How will the output be visualized?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The project did not require a visual output, so I could have settled with a
            two dimensional or simple terminal output. However, I thought it would be a 
            better idea to integrate Matplotlib functionality to see what the filled bins
            would look like. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Matplotlib Issue</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            While integrating Matplotlib, I ran into an issue where a small box placed
            within a larger bin had open space under it, the visualization would fill
            in this space. The issue was a simple OR instead of an XOR. Once I used an
            XOR, the issue was resolved and images were correctly displayed. The image
            left image below shows the issue. The image on the right is the correct output.
          </p>
          <div class="issue-image-wrapper">
            <img src="../assets/images/projects/binpacking/testing_visuals/testC(box2).png"
            alt=""
            loading="lazy"
            class="issue-image"
            />

    <!-- What I Would Do Differently -->
    <section class="project-changes">
      <h2>What I Would Do Differntly</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I would add a method of re-evaluating the subsections within the larger
          bins. This could help in the end and ensure more volume is utilized well. 
          This may increase the execution time of the program and result in the 
          same problem initially put forth, but it would be worth researching further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a single color for the used volume inside of a larger bin, I would 
          distinctly color each kind of smaller bin. This would help distinquish which
          small bins were placed where. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to modifying the colors of the utilized space, I would also output 
          how many smaller boxes are contained within the larger bins. If the colors
          were changed and the output was given, I think it would drastically help see
          and understand where each smaller box was in the larger bins.
