          This project is an android application with a backend API. The goal is to 
          allow users to join a group and share photos and videos taken while part of 
          the group automatically. This would be done through peer-to-peer connections 
          instead of a server handling the files. The server will contain user 
          information such as email, username, IP, current group, photos to share, and 
          received photos. You can view my presentation

    <!-- What I Learned -->

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Using Django and Python, I created a functioning API that allowed me to 
          create users, allow users to sign in and track user information. To see this 
          portion of the project, visit 
          <a href="https://github.com/willbushie/CSC491-WebServer" target="_blank"
          >this repository</a> which contains the backend API for the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked with Android Studio in the past, I was familiar with Java and 
          basic application structures. This project taught me a lot more about the 
          kinds of things Android Studio can do and how to design a practical application.
        </p>
        <p>
          User Experience was a huge focus during this project. I wanted to ensure the 
          user would join groups and forget about the application. I did not want an 
          intrusive and time consuming processes. Simply create or join a group 
          (via QR code or URL), and enjoy the time with friends or family. Once done, 
          leave the group, or pause sharing for a time if needed. Simplicity was important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Networking is very difficult if you do not have previous experience with it. I 
          ran into a lot of issues with networking while working on this project. I did 
          not really have an initial plan, and I spent a large portion of this project 
          researching and troubleshooting these issues. I unfortunately did not get the 
          application working on a NAT. I have a much greater understanding of networking 
          after working on this project.

      <h2>Issues & Resolutions</h2>
      <div class="project-single-issue">
        <h3>What kind of application should I make?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I used Android Studio since I had an Android Phone to better test the 
            application. I had also previously worked with Android Studio and Java 
            making it an easy decision. I wanted to create an IOS application as well, 
            but due to time and hardware constraints, I was unable to accomplish that.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What backend tools should I use?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I settled on Django and Python for the backend of the application. This 
            was due to my previous familiarity to Python and Django did not appear to 
            be much of a learning curve. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>My development environment became an issue multiple times.</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            This is simply due to the age of my hardware, but I figured it was still 
            worth noting. I needed to do multiple things to my development environment 
            to ensure I could continue work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Networking became the largest issue with the project.</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            I never had any real experience dealing with networking. I understood the 
            basics, but due to the nature of the project (peer-to-peer connections), 
            networking prevented the project from going further. NAT (Network Address 
            Translation) traversal became my main focus for the last stretch of this 
            project, but I was unable to resolve the issue. I was able to get two users 
            to connect to a group while on the same network, but was unable to do the 
            same while on different networks.
          </p>
        </div>

    <!-- What I Would Do Differently -->
    <section class="project-changes">
      <h2>What I Would Do Differntly</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I would have gone about the project differently. Networking became a huge issue 
          in this project. The idea made sense, however implementing such a confusing 
          networking configuration was out of the scope of this project. NAT (Network 
          Address Translation) traversal became the rock in the road preventing this 
          project from completion. Due to simplicity reason, I probably would have just 
          sent all files to a central server and had the user pull from the server. It 
          wouldn't have resulted in the problems regarding networking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have used a different backend framework. Using Python and Django was 
          nice since I had previous experience with Python, however I found Django confusing 
          at times and not very well organized. I would use React instead if I did this 
          project again. Although I did not have JavaScript experience at the time, I think 
          it would have given me better real world work experience than Django did.
