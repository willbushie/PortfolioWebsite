          This was an assigned team project. The goal was to create a Windows application 
          using C# and the .NET framework to to do basic Binary arithmetic and specific 
          conversion commonly made in the IT field. There were a total of four team members 
          on this project. The project focused on agile development and followed four weeks, 
          each with a week long sprint.

    <!-- What I Learned -->

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <div>
        <p>        
          This was my first team project. The team had four members, a team lead, frontend 
          developer, primary programmer (this was my role), and secondary programmer. This 
          project showed me how much more efficient a team can be compared to a single 
          developer. The team lead would split up and assign work to the developers. This 
          allowed work to continue at the same pace, but everyone needed to do less overall 
          work, improving quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main focus on this project was the functionality of the application. Handling
          user inputs and outputing the correct answer. I worked with the secondary programmer 
          and the frontend developer to create the functioning application. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Agile development allows for quicker pivoting and focus shifting not available 
          with older development methods. This helped shift our focus where needed through 
          the sprints so we could deliver the best end product.

          More extensive error checking. Some of the inputs should have been checked more 
          extensively. There is error checking, however it would be preferred to have a 
          better explanation so the user understands why an error occurred. This is 
          especially important for Mac Address inputs and conversion to Mac Addresses. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Automated testing would have drastically helped. We would have needed to develop 
          a way of doing this testing ourselves, which would have been another good 
          experience. The testing process we used was manually checking inputs for 
          expected outputs and keeping track with a shared spreadsheet.
