          This was a personal project. The goal was to showcase my previous work and gain 
          experience with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a basic

    <!-- What I Learned -->

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Although I had worked with HTML in the past, I did not work with it 
          to this extent. It has shown me that frontend design can be confusing 
          if you don't have a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really never worked with CSS in the past. Understanding how CSS 
          connects to the HTML and how CSS can be used to create dynamically 
          changing webpages based on screen sizes is very useful.
        </p>

    <!-- Issues & Resolutions -->
    <section class="project-issues">
      <h2>Issues & Resolutions</h2>
      <div class="project-single-issue">
        <h3>How do I make the pages dynamic to different screen sizes?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            f I had used a web framework, this would have been much easier. Since 
            I wanted to focus on basic HTML, CSS, and JS, I needed to use basic CSS 
            and conditions to change the pages based on different screen sizes. 
            This seemed to work pretty well, but in some cases the results are 
            mediocre at best.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Where will I get the domain?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            This took some minor research and I eventually ended up on Google 
            Domains. This seemed like a relatively easy service to interact with 
            and the domain was very cheap.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Where will I deploy the website?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Although I didn't want to ensure costs with this project, I figured 
            it would be best to get experience deploying a website to AWS. I 
            investigated AWS S3 since my website didn't require any server side 
            processing. All the webpages would be processed by the browser. 
          </p>

    <!-- What I Would Do Differently -->
    <section class="project-changes">
      <h2>What I Would Do Differntly</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Some of the styling on the website is not the best. I would have taken 
          more time to really think about styling and how the pages will change 
          with different screen sizes. I did try to make sure the majority of the 
          website was cohesive and dynamic based on different screen sizes, but it 
          isn't always the greatest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the goal of this project was to focus on HTML, CSS, and 
          JavaScript without a framework, a JS framework would have greatly helped. 
          Developing in a single language instead of three would have drastically 
          reduced the amount of development time for the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a framework would have given me more exposure to JavaScript. The 
          only times I really needed to utilize JS was with basic website functionality, 
          such as the Hamburger Menu on narrow screen sizes. The majority of this 
          project was focused on HTML and CSS, and I wish I would have gotten more 
          work with JS.
