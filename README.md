## Portfolio Website
This repository contains all code for my personal website. The goal was to not only show my previous work, but also get experience creating a basic website without the help of any frameworks. I wanted to better appreciate those tools, and I have never created a website from scratch before.

As I add to my portfolio, I will update the projects page with my most recent projects once they are completed.

## What I Learned
- Although I had worked with HTML in the past, I did not work with it to this extent. It has shown me that frontend design can be confusing if you don't have a plan.
- I really never worked with CSS in the past. Understanding how CSS connects to the HTML and how CSS can be used to create dynamically changing webpages based on screen sizes is very useful.

## Results
- The landing page of the website gives a brief overview of me. 
- From the landing page, the navbar will take a user to the projects page. This is the focus of the website. Any and all previous projects, assigned or personal, are held here. Each project has a page devoted to it. The page includes things very similar to this README. What I learned, what tools I used, issues I encountered and how I resolved them, and what I would do differently.
- I'm fairly happy with this website. It was my first time getting real experience with frontend design, and although there are section that still need work, I think it accomplishes the goal I set out to do. 

## Issues
1. How do I make the pages dynamic to different screen sizes?
- If I had used a web framework, this would have been much easier. Since I wanted to focus on basic HTML, CSS, and JS, I needed to use basic CSS and conditions to change the pages based on different screen sizes. This seemed to work pretty well, but in some cases the results are mediocre at best.
2. Where will I get the domain?
- This took some minor research and I eventually ended up on Google Domains. This seemed like a relatively easy service to interact with and the domain was very cheap. 
3. Where will I deploy the website?
- Although I didn't want to ensure costs with this project, I figured it would be best to get experience deploying a website to AWS. I investigated AWS S3 since my website didn't require any server side processing. All the webpages would be processed by the browser. 

## What I Would Do Differently
- Some of the styling on the website is not the best. I would have taken more time to really think about styling and how the pages will change with different screen sizes. I did try to make sure the majority of the website was cohesive and dynamic based on different screen sizes, but it isn't always the greatest.
- Even though the goal of this project was to focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a framework, a JS framework would have greatly helped. Developing in a single language instead of three would have drastically reduced the amount of development time for the project.
- Using a framework would have given me more exposure to JavaScript. The only times I really needed to utilize JS was with basic website functionality, such as the Hamburger Menu on narrow screen sizes. The majority of this project was focused on HTML and CSS, and I wish I would have gotten more work with JS.
